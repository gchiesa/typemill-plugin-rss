# Typemill Plugin RSS

This plugin for [Typemill](https://typemill.net) V2.x, allow you to build and publish an RSS Feed with the content
of your blog.

## How it works

The plugin implement a new route (`/rss`) on all folders that will generate an RSS feed for the specific folder.
In each html new meta is also added to advertise the availability of the RSS feed.

The homepage as well will contain an RSS feed with all the published post/pages.

## Configuration

The title and description of this generic RSS feed can be set in the plugin settings.

## Special thanks

The plugin is largely based on the foundational work made by [azettl](https://github.com/azettl/typemill.plugin.rss)
for Typemill V1.x
